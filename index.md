## Wick Alternatives for Animators

### The big two, err, three
[**Adobe Animate**](https://www.adobe.com/products/animate), formerly Flash Professional (https://www.adobe.com/products/animate) - $/mo - 🪟🍎🍷 (WINE only works with versions before *and including* CS6)

Well, duh.

If you don't want a monthly subscription, find an older version on eBay under the Flash brand, preferrably bundled with Adobe CS4 or Macromedia Studio 8. Then search up for serial numbers online.

For all you freeloaders out there, there's a lot of options at your disposal. **KEYGENS AND PREACTIVATED VERSIONS ARE NOT LEGAL IN ANY WAY WHATSOEVER. PLEASE DO NOT USE THEM. Instead, use serial numbers** For instance, I've made [FlashPack](https://archive.org/details/flashpack), which compiles all Adobe Animate versions before Adobe bought Macromedia in 2005.

[**ToonBoom Harmony**](https://shop.toonboom.com/en) (https://shop.toonboom.com/en) - $ - 🪟🍎🐧 (Linux version only for corporations/studios)

The other industry standard. Used in *everything* animated in 2D /s.

[**TVPaint**](https://www.tvpaint.com/) - $ -  🪟🍎🐧

The other other industry standard. It's been used in a couple of well-known films that I am not going to bother listing.

### Everything else

[**Moho**](https://moho.lostmarble.com/) (formerly Anime Studio) - $ (no subscription service as of 2024/08/23) - 🪟🍎

[**OpenToonz**](https://opentoonz.github.io/e/) (https://opentoonz.github.io/e/) - @ - 🪟🍎🐧 (Linux version through package managers like snap and apt, external repo may be required)

Forked from Toonz Premium, which was used in pre-reboot Futurama and earlier Spongebob seasons (seasons 2&ndash;6 i think). The OpenToonz version is used by Studio Ghibli for their digital ink-and-paint films (essentially digital lineart with pencil sketches) like Spirited Away or The Boy and the Heron.

OpenToonz is ***open***-source software that is still being updated. No stable release for about a year, but the repository still has activity.

Toonz Premium is not in development as of 2024/08/23.

[**Blender**](https://blender.org/) (https://blender.org/) - @ - 🪟🍎🐧

Betcha didn't know that Blender has 2D animation, did you? This is done via the Grease Pencil.

[**Clip Studio Paint**](https://www.clipstudio.net/en/) (https://www.clipstudio.net/en/) - $ - 🪟🍎🤖📱🍷

JAPANESE ANIME, LACKADAISY AND POSSIBLY CURSE WORD: THE CARTOON USE THIS IN THEIR PIPELINES. NO JOKE.

[**Krita**](https://krita.org/) (https://krita.org/) - @ - 🪟🍎🐧

I've used Clip Studio Paint briefly and this is just that but licensed under [Richard Stallman's license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). Mainly a digital paint program, so if you also want to storyboard or do character designs without leaving the app then it's possible.

Its animation capabilities are very good from what I've done in it.

[**Vectorian Giotto**](https://web.archive.org/web/20130102022449/http://www.vectorian.com/) (http://www.vectorian.com, archived via web.archive.org) - @ - 🪟🍎🍷 (WINE is hit-or-miss with this program)

This is not in active development anymore. However, much like pre-CC Adobe Animate versions, it is pretty stable.

[**Anime Effects**](https://animeeffectsdevs.github.io/) (https://animeeffectsdevs.github.io/) - @ - 🪟🍎🐧

This looks pretty decent, but considering that there's only one guy working on it, we might have another Wick situation on our hands.

[**ibisPaint X**](https://ibispaint.com/?lang=en-US) (https://ibispaint.com/?lang=en-US) - **~** - 🪟🤖📱 (Windows version only free for like 1 hour. Think of AOL CDs but with less time. I wasn't even around to UTILIZE them to be honest)

No sound as of now, update this statement with "No comment." if we ever do get sound.

[**FlipaClip**](https://flipaclip.com/) (https://flipaclip.com/) - **~** - 🤖📱

No comment.

[**Procreate Dreams**](https://procreate.com/dreams) (https://procreate.com/dreams) - $ - 📱

See FlipaClip.

[**TurboWarp**](https://turbowarp.org) (https://turbowarp.org) - @ - 🕸️🪟🍎🐧

A more powerful Scratch, but without all the bloat, all the restrictions, all the creepy users and people going "ratioed" or "HOW DARE YOU REMIX" (note that all Scratch content is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0](https://en.scratch-wiki.info/wiki/Creative_Commons_License), _hel-lo!!!_) or get into pointless wars.

This also counts as a game engine!

[**Scratch**](https://scratch.mit.edu/) (https://scratch.mit.edu/) - @ - 🕸️🪟🍎🐧🤖📱

See TurboWarp.

This also counts as a game engine!

[**Mooltk**](https://github.com/ruskakimov/mooltik) (https://github.com/ruskakimov/mooltik) - @ - 🤖📱

Hasn't been updated at all in a year according to the repo's activity. Sounds familiar?
